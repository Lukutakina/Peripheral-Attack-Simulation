# Peripheral-Attack-Simulation
The purpose of this project is to create a non-malicious peripheral device that runs an executable program when attached to another device. While the device runs non-malicious executable, it means to exhibit the possibilities of a real-life attack of such kind of attack where the attacker is hostile.
